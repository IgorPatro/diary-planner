## Available Scripts

First you need to create your own .env file to initialize your firebase app locally. That will look like this:

`REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=................................ REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=................................ REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=................................ REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=................................ REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=................................ REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=................................`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Using App

There are created some custom credentials. If you will use them, you will be able to login to the app and and add notes what will be `public` and anyone who will login with those credentials, will see your notes!

`Email: example@example.com`
`Password: 123456`

### `creating your own account`

You don't need to verify your email, so you can make up the false one and use it during the creation process.
